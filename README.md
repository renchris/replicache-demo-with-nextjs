  Replicache Demo With NextJS
</h1>

A NextJS App Router project that follows the Replicache Demos: Todo Row Versioning, Introduction, and Build Your Own Back End.

Please refer to the `main` branch for the Todo Row Versioning and `build-your-own-backend` branch for the Introduction and  Build Your Own Back End Demos.

## 🥞 Stack Changes from Demos

- Vanilla JavaScript → NextJS App Router with `use server` and `use client` components

- PandaCSS

- Postgres → Drizzle + SQLite (better-sqlite3)

- Pusher → Soketi

## ⏩ NextJS App Router

The significant feature of Next.js App Router is [Server Components](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/server-components).

This allows more of your application to receive the [benefits of server rendering](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/server-components#benefits-of-server-rendering).

## 🐼 PandaCSS

[PandaCSS](https://panda-css.com/) is our preferred UI framework. It was launched by the Chakra UI team with the developer experience, semantics, and readability like with Chakra UI and zero runtime CSS-in-JS for Server Components compatibility like with TailwindCSS.

## ☔️ Drizzle + SQLite

We use [Drizzle](https://orm.drizzle.team/docs/overview) as our ORM that is lightweight, performant, and SQL-like with our local database of choice: SQLite.

Once the database is initialized, you may use [Drizzle Studio](https://orm.drizzle.team/drizzle-studio/overview) to see our tables.

First, run the command:

```bash
pnpm drizzle-kit studio
```

Which will run at a local address:

```bash
Drizzle Studio is up and running on http://0.0.0.0:xxxx
```

Open the URL in your browser to see our tables and data.

## 🔌 Pusher and Soketi

We use [Soketi](https://soketi.app/) for our web socket service to send and receive pokes. When we push data, send a poke to notify all other applications to pull for the updated data. No data is actually sent with pokes.

While we use Soketi to host our websocket endpoint server we still use the [Pusher SDK](https://pusher.com/docs/channels/library_auth_reference/pusher-websockets-protocol/). However, our endpoint is now our self-hosted Soketi server instead of Pusher's priced and managed service server.

We need to use the [Pusher JS library](https://github.com/pusher/pusher-js) for instances and functions on the client side and the [Pusher library (pusher-http-node)](https://github.com/pusher/pusher-http-node) for instances and functions on the server side.

Note that the Pusher client instance parameters are slightly different between the client `pusher-js` library and the server `pusher` library.

We do not need a Pusher account or app.

We don't need soketi as a project dependency of our NextJS application but have access to running a Soketi server through their command line.

The fields of the app id, key, and cluster are required parameters but the values are insignificant and aren't used.

The important parameter values are port and host.

We use `soketi start` to start our local Soketi server.

In production, we would continually run our soketi server in a container by way of command line or docker file in a virtual instance such as AWS EC2/ECS, Fly.io, or Digital Ocean.

## 🚀 Usage

Install the application dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

### 🔌 Start Your Soketi Server

Install the Soketi command line:

```bash
pnpm install -g @soketi/soketi
```

Then, run the local Soketi server:

```bash
soketi start
```

### 🔑 Generate your Replicache License Key

Run the command:

```bash
pnpm dlx replicache@latest get-license
```

Then, add your key to your `.env.local` file.

```bash
REPLICACHE_LICENSE_KEY=your-license-key-here
```

### 📘 Initialize your database

Run the Drizzle push command:

```bash
pnpm push
```


### 🚀 Run the application

Run the command:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Ensure that the host and port is of the same in the Soketi server as the NextJS application.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

You may comment out the `<IntroductionDemo/>` component or the `<Chat/>` component to run the respective code for the Introduction Demo or the Bring Your Own Back End (Chat) Demo.

## 🎨 Code Style

We use ESLint for our code style. You may modify the ESLint rule set in the `.eslintrc.js` file. Include ESLint On Save in your code editor Preferences settings.

```JSON
{
    "editor.codeActionsOnSave": {
        "source.fixAll.eslint": true
    }
}
```
